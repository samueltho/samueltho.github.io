      <description>Reflections on discoveries I was recently chatting to someone in my team and we spent a few moments discussing how we had not had a team &amp;ldquo;kick off&amp;rdquo;/&amp;ldquo;inception&amp;rdquo;/&amp;ldquo;discovery&amp;rdquo; week for the product/initiative we were working on. This got me thinking about how incredible achievement it was that we had managed to align as a team and start building something new from the ground up all within a few days.
In this case it was quite easy not to have an extensive discovery week: the problem we were needing to solve was in essence handed to us - our team is building some services and algorithms that connect to something much bigger.</description>
