      <description>Living with restrictions I live in Barcelona which had quite a strict lockdown during 2020. Since the summer there hasn&amp;rsquo;t been another lockdown, but there have been lots of restrictions (de-facto lockdown) at various times. These restrictions have on-off closed climbing gyms and travel bans have made climbing outdoors not possible. I wanted to reflect a bit on how last year impacted my climbing.
Training did me a lot of good&amp;hellip; Overall, I think the restrictions actually helped me be a much better climber.</description>
