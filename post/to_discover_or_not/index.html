<h1 id="reflections-on-discoveries">Reflections on discoveries</h1>
<p>I was recently chatting to someone in my team and we spent a few moments discussing how we had not had a team &ldquo;kick off&rdquo;/&ldquo;inception&rdquo;/&ldquo;discovery&rdquo; week for the product/initiative we were working on.  This got me thinking about how incredible achievement it was that we had managed to align as a team and start building something new from the ground up all within a few days.</p>
<p>In this case it was quite easy not to have an extensive discovery week: the problem we were needing to solve was in essence handed to us - our team is building some services and algorithms that connect to something much bigger.  But none the less the experience did give me a chance to reflext on some of the advantages and disadvantages of taking time out of the teams normal schedule for discovery/kick off/inception.</p>
<h1 id="a-prerequisite---always-start-together">A prerequisite - ALWAYS START TOGETHER</h1>
<p>Despite there being advantages and disadvantages to hosting discovery weeks, there really is no downside to starting together.  Everyone from the team should be part of those crucial conversations about the problem space; potential ideas for solutions; user research etc.  Aside from this just making sense (no need to try and realign, or re-answer questions when the time comes to share context with the team) it is also good for business - amazing ideas always come up at this stage, and involving the very people (the team!) who have the deepest understanding of the the customer &amp; the product only increases the chance of discovering new ways of solving the problem.</p>
<p>For more on starting together <a href="https://cutlefish.substack.com/p/tbm-453-teach-by-starting-together">John Cutler</a> is a great place to start.</p>
<h1 id="the-pros">The pros</h1>
<p>Anyways, there are lots of advantages to a dedicated discovery week:</p>
<h3 id="a-natural-startend-point">A natural start/end point</h3>
<p>If the team is going to be working on something brand new, whether that be a new product or problem, taking time out from the normal routine can make this feel like a fresh start, and helps mark the occasion.  It can also help inspire the team - which can be useful if there are new team members.</p>
<h3 id="working-with-busy-stakeholders">Working with busy stakeholders</h3>
<p>Sometimes stakeholders from outside the team can be crucial to understanding a new problem.  Being able to invite them for whole days at a time has always been easier that trying to have them join shorter but more regular team workshops.</p>
<h3 id="a-chance-to-deep-dive-into-a-topic">A chance to deep dive into a topic</h3>
<p>Sometimes it can be challenging to find a way to build discovery activities into the teams normal schedule.  If this is the case a dedicated week can help the team really focus and deep dive into a topic.</p>
<h1 id="the-cons">The cons</h1>
<p>But there are also some downsides:</p>
<h3 id="encourages-creative-thinking-to-happen-irregularly-and-in-batches">Encourages creative thinking to happen irregularly and in batches</h3>
<p>In several teams where I have worked discovery weeks were seen as the time to be creative and to deep dive into problems.  If a problem was looming it was seen as best to wait until the next discovery.  This made it more difficult to create a product culture whereby creative thought is part of every day.</p>
<h3 id="thinking-too-big">Thinking too big?</h3>
<p>What happens if you have lots of small problems to solve rather than one big one?  I find it harder to have a focused week of discovery if the team is more experiment focused and/or is tackling a collection of smaller problems.</p>
<h3 id="exhausting-and-disruptive">Exhausting and disruptive</h3>
<p>Planning for a week of discovery is a huge undertaking.  Often lots of data and insights need to be collected.  Stakeholders invited.  Buy in sought.  Taking care of all the logistics can be exhausting in itself, before even starting with the discovery itself.  It can also mean neglecting some work in the weeks leading up to the discovery in order to prepare.</p>
<h1 id="so-what-do-i-prefer">So what do I prefer?</h1>
<p>I think it depends!  In some teams I have found them very beneficial.  Particularly when we were just starting out with building a more creative culture.  But in others - they have been a bit of a blocker to problem solving (&ldquo;let&rsquo;s wait for the next discovery to start talking about that problem!&quot;).  I think you need to look at the nature of the products you are building and the dynamics of the team in order to make an informed decision.</p>
